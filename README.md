## Two friends trying to get back home for Christmas. 

Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Pedro who was trying to go back home for Christmas to see his family for the holidays. He goes to University called the Broccoli University. Pedro was packing his clothes and some other stuff that he is bringing back home for Christmas. Over 10 minutes or so after packing his stuff, he finally went to car to load his stuff in the car. While he was loading his stuff in the car, he heard a footsteps coming close and as he looks over, it was his friend Manny. 

“Yooo! What’s up man!? How’s it going?” Manny said.

“Yooo! What’s up Manny!?” Not bad, just chilling you know. Just about to leave to go back home for Christmas, you know. Pedro replied to his friend. 

“Ayyy, same here man! Manny said. 

But Manny looks really sad, nervous, and stressed. He looked like he wanted to say something to Pedro, but he is really nervous to asked or say something to his friend. 

“Hey man, you good?!” Pedro asked, “You look really sad and stressed man”

“I am okay man; I was just wondering if I could get a ride back home, because my car broke down” Manny replied. 

“For sure man, I could do that!” Pedro said

So, Pedro helped Manny with some of his stuff to his car. After they loaded all their stuff in Pedro’s car and finally Pedro started his car. However, he noticed that he did not have his GPS. He wondered where he put it. Pedro has a worried look on his face because without his GPS he wouldn’t know how to get back home and how will he drop off Manny to his house. 

“What are you looking for Pedro?” Manny asked. 

“I think I may have misplaced my GPS man” Pedro replied to his friend

“Ohhhh… Don’t worry about it I have an extra one, you can have it for now” Manny said

“Thank you so much man! I’ll for sure give it back to you when we get back from the holidays” Pedro said

However, Manny’s GPS does not have enough load up or tap up that could last their trip for 3 hours until they get to Pedro’s and Manny’s house. The only way they could load up their GPS and to connect to the navigation satellite is by stopping by to little convenient store called Mini-Stop which is 20-minutes’ drive from their University. 
After few minutes when Pedro realized that their GPS needs a tap up 

“Hey Manny, I don’t think we have enough load up on our GPS” Pedro said 

“Ohhh… yeah I forgot to load it up earlier, I think we have to stop by at Mini-Stop on the way” Manny replied 

“Yeah about that, I don’t know the closest one from Broccoli University” Pedro replied to Manny looking worried. 

“That is true! I might know the way, but if I do not remember we could also ask some other people on the street if they know any Mini-Stop around the area. But I am pretty sure there is one like 20 minutes away from us” Manny said.

“Okay, we could do that too” Pedro said.

Pedro and Manny drove off to the nearest Mini-Stop. 

After 10-15 minutes, since they left the University. Manny realized that he does not remember the road anymore. 

“I think we have to ask the directions now Pedro, because I am kind of confused of the directions right now” Manny said.

“About that, is it okay if you could ask for the directions because I am a little embarrass to ask for  directions from other people” Pedro replied. 

“For sure bud, I could definitely do that for you!” Manny replied looking confident.

When they saw a man on the street walking, Pedro drove close to the man and Manny rolled down his window. 

“Hello sir, how are you doing today?” Manny asked 

“I’m good, how about you guys?” The man replied to both Pedro and Manny. 

“We’re good! Sorry to bother you sir, my friend and I are just a little bit lost right now; we are just wondering if we could ask you for some directions” replied to the man. 
“For sure, where are you guys heading too?” asked by the man.

Manny replied, “My friend and I are going back home for the holidays, and we are just wondering if you know the convenient store called Mini-Stop that could load-up GPS’s?” 

“Ohh… there’s a lot of Mini-Stop’s around this area and the closest one here is actually not that far from here, probably 5 minutes away…” 

“Thank you so much sir!” Manny and Pedro said to the man. 

They drove off to Mini-Stop and after a few minutes they finally found it, and they got off the car and went inside the store.

“Hello sir, I was just wondering if I could load up my GPS that could last a 3 to 4 hours road trip? Pedro asked to the helper of the store.

“Hi there, I do not think I have enough to load up your GPS because someone just loaded up their GPS earlier, but I would double check for you guys, okay?” replied by the helper. 

“Please, thank you so much!” Pedro replied. 

“So, I just checked guys and I could only do like 30 to 40 percent to load up on your GPS and that would only last you guys an hour of your road trip” The helper said
The look on Pedro and Manny’s faces is an expression of sadness. 

“But if you guys could wait, I can load up my machine but that would take up to 30 to 40 minutes of wait for you guys. 

“What do you think, Manny? I don’t mind waiting, I don’t know about you though.? Pedro asked. 

“For sure man, I don’t mind waiting!” Manny replied

“We could wait sir, here is the GPS.” Pedro said.

After waiting 30 to 40 minutes, the helper finally called Pedro and Manny. 

“Here you go guys, you guys are all set and now your GPS is fully loaded that would definitely last you guys for 3 to 4 hours. Thank you for waiting, have a good day and safe trip!” the helper replied.  

“Thank you so much sir, now we can go home. Have a good day!” replied by Pedro 

Pedro and Manny finally left the store and got in the car. 

“Let’s go home!” Manny said. 

“Let’s go!” Pedro replied excitedly 

After waiting for an hour or so of figuring out how to get to the Mini-Stop, asking for directions and how to load up their GPS. Pedro started his car, he set-up and connect the GPS to the navigation satellite and connected the direction to get home, they finally took off to go home.
